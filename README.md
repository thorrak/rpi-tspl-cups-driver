# rpi-tspl-cups-driver
CUPS Driver for TSPL-based label printers on the Raspberry Pi 



Inspired by [this Hackaday post](https://hackaday.io/project/184984-cheap-poshmark-label-printer-iphone-airprint) to bring a CUPS driver for TSPL-based printers. This includes:

- iDPRT SP420

Uses the [modifications made by Proski](https://github.com/proski/cups) to rastertolabel to create a suitable driver that functions for the printers listed above.
